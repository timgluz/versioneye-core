# versioneye-core

This project contains the core elements of [VersionEye](https://www.versioneye.com).

 - Models & Persistence
 - Services
 - Mailers
 - Parsers
 - RabbitMQ Producers & Workers

This project is used as a dependency in all other Ruby projects of [VersionEye](https://www.versioneye.com).

This project is setup and managed with [jeweler](https://www.versioneye.com/ruby/jeweler).
A great Ruby project to manage a Ruby Gem project.

## Start the backend services for VersionEye

This project contains a [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file which describes the backend services
of VersionEye. You can start the backend services like this:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

That will start:

 - MongoDB
 - RabbitMQ
 - ElasticSearch
 - Memcached

For persistence you should comment in and adjust the mount volumes in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)
for MongoDB and ElasticSearch. If you are not interested in persisting the data on your host you can
let it untouched.

Shutting down the backend services works like this:

```
docker-compose down
```

## Configuration

All important configuration values are read from environment variable. Before you start
VersioneyeCore.new you should adjust the values in [scripts/set_vars_for_dev.sh](scripts/set_vars_for_dev.sh)
and load them like this:

```
source ./scripts/set_vars_for_dev.sh
```

The most important env. variables are the ones for the backend services, which point to MongoDB, ElasticSearch,
RabbitMQ and Memcached.

## Install dependencies

If the backend services are all up and running and the environment variables are set correctly
you can install the dependencies with `bundler`. If `bundler` is not installed on your machine
run this command to install it:

```
gem install bundler
```

Then you can install the dependencies like this:

```
bundle install
```

## Ruby console

If the dependencies are installed correctly you can start the Ruby console like this:

```
rake console
```

And initiate VersionEye Core like this:

```
VersioneyeCore.new
```

Now you can play with the models and services!

## Tests

The tests for this project are running after each `git push` on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/versioneye/versioneye-core)!
First of all a Docker image is build for this project and the tests are executed inside of a Docker container.
For more details take a look to the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and the [circle.yml](circle.yml) file in the root directory!

If the Docker containers for the backend services are running locally, the tests can be executed locally
with this command:

```
./scripts/runtests_local.sh
```

Make sure that you followed the steps in the configuration section, before you run the tests!
